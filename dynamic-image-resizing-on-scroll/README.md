# Dynamic Image Resizing on Scroll

This repository contains a simple web page demonstrating dynamic resizing of an image as the user scrolls. The image will decrease in size when the user scrolls down and return to its original size when scrolling up.


## Features

- An image that dynamically resizes based on the scroll position.
- Smooth transitions for image resizing.
- A fixed header that remains at the top of the page.
- Random text paragraphs to illustrate the scroll effect.

## Usage

For any image that you wish to be dynamically resizing, just apply the class name "dynamic-resize".
