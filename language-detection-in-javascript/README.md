# Language Detection in JavaScript

## Overview
This project features a simple JavaScript implementation for detecting whether a user is typing in Arabic or English in real-time. It utilizes regular expressions to identify Arabic characters and dynamically updates the language status.

## Features
- **Real-Time Language Detection**: Automatically detects the language being typed (Arabic or English).
- **Use of Regular Expressions**: Employs regex to identify Arabic characters in the input.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Language status is updated with each keystroke.

## How It Works
The script listens for the `keyup` event on an input field. As the user types, the entered text is evaluated against a regular expression that matches Arabic characters. Depending on the input, the script updates the displayed language status.

## Usage
1. Type text into the provided input field.
2. The language (Arabic or English) of the text will be displayed below the input field as you type.
