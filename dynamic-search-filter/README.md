# Dynamic Search Filter

The `dynamic-search-filter` is a simple yet powerful HTML and JavaScript implementation that enables real-time searching and filtering of content within a webpage.

## Overview

The key feature of this project is an interactive search field that filters the displayed content in real-time based on the user's input. It's particularly useful for improving the user experience in web applications where instant feedback from search input is necessary.

## Features

- **Real-time Filtering**: Instantly filters content based on user input.
- **JavaScript and HTML**: Purely implemented using vanilla JavaScript and HTML.
- **Ease of Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing web projects.

## How It Works

The main functionality is driven by JavaScript that listens to the 'keyup' event on the search input field. As the user types, the script filters the visible content in the div elements that don't match the search query.
